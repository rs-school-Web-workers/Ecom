    shortBio: `Hello, my name is Danila! ðŸŒŸ I graduated "MITSO" with a degree in marketing economics. I live in Minsk, I love sports, learning new things, reading books, and never standing still. My journey into front-end development started two years ago when I decided to switch career paths. I took paid courses from scratch, tried to find a job, but felt a lack of confidence in my knowledge and practical skills. Thanks to my friends' advice, I knew about RSSchool. That's how I ended up here and got what I was missing and even more! Thanks for this challenging year. ðŸš€âœ¨`,
