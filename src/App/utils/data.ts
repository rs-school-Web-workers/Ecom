    shortBio: `Hello, my name is Danila! ðŸŒŸ I graduated "MITSO" with a degree in marketing economics. I live in Minsk, I love sports, learning new things, reading books, and never standing still. My journey into front-end development started two years ago when I decided to switch career paths. I took paid courses from scratch, tried to find a job, but felt a lack of confidence in my knowledge and practical skills. Thanks to my friends' advice, I knew about RSSchool. That's how I ended up here and got what I was missing and even more! Thanks for this challenging year. ðŸš€âœ¨`,

    shortBio: `Hello! My name is Kiryl. This year I graduated from BSUIR. I learned php online and I have a small work expirience on inner project of bsuir lab.  Currently Iâ€™m employed as sysadmin in ministry of finance. And Iâ€™m actively looking for a new job as developer. My main focus is on becoming a fullstack developer, because Iâ€™m interested in web development at whole. About me as a human being. I like discovering new things, thats why I chose riding a bicycle as my major hobby. When its too cold to ride a bicycle I prefer swimming. Sometimes I like to play big tennis with my little cousin at Minsk arena. As the way to switch my intellectual activity I learn how to make electronic music.`,

    shortBio: `Hello, my name is Tatiana. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and have a master's degree in physical and mathematical sciences. I live in Brest, I adore books and devote almost all my free time to reading, sing, draw and try to enjoy everything I do. While studying at the university, I learned the basics of front-end, and after learning about Rolling Scope School, I decided to challenge myself and consolidate my existing knowledge and gain new ones. Over the course of these 8 months, I have made an amazing journey and gained knowledge that I will undoubtedly try to put into practice. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of RSShool.`,
